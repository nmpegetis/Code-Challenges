## First Unique Character in a String
---
Given a string `s`, return the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return `-1`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcba"
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abba"
Output: -1
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
